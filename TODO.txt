* Precompute rough thin sheet reflectance. It's a 3D function
 * Move integration to OptiXRenderer util
 * Precompute reflection and transmission scaling coefficients
* Disable refraction in thin-walled materials and 1 / ior^2 radiance correction (which should cancel out for thin sheets)
 * Do it inside transmissive material first. Then we can generalize if we need to for default material
 * Test that there is no refraction
 * Disney uses 0.65 * relative_ior + 0.35 to scale the transmissive roughness (Extending the Disney BRDF to a BSDF with Integrated Subsurface Scattering, Burley et all, Figure 15)
* Test!
* Should support cutout (Kalestra as glass)

BACKLOG:
* Transmissive coat
 * Implement a coated material integrater. Similar to the thin_sheet integrator and should support double sided materials ingrained in glass
  * Coat tint is squareroot of actual tint (tint in and tint out)
 * Test alpha that approximates double GGX distribution for the underlying surface
  * Fit a spherical distribution or just take variance of the sampled directions
 * Apply coat to both reflection and refraction when thinwalled, only reflection when non-thinwalled
 * Test that coated evaluated rho matches sampled rho
 * Validate sampling probabilities.
* Apply darkening from total internal reflection to coated materials?
* Upgrade OptiX to get better denoiser
 * sea_keep_lonely_watcher shows bright artifacts on transparent geometry. They seem to come from the anyhit programs not always intersecting all geometry, but stopping after the first nearest intersections.
 * Implement statistical denoiser as https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3680528.3687591
* Improving shadow terminator
 * Reflections: Hacking the shadow terminator https://jo.dreggn.org/home/2021_terminator.pdf
 * Refractions: Taming the shadow terminator https://www.yiningkarlli.com/projects/shadowterminator.html
* Rough glass
 * Thinwalled transmissive smooth materials can tint the anyhit of next event estimations. But remember to take the previous BSDF PDF into account
 * Add support for local refraction in the coat in default shading.
 * Approximate rough glass in DX11 using a gaussian filter, see Doom 2016.
  * Implement transmissive material with energy conservation.
  * Possibly expand with OIT using moments, as transparency is a PITA https://momentsingraphics.de/MissingTMBOITCode.html
 * Integrate rough glass into DefaultShading
  * Integrate as coat + coat_t * ((GGX_R + GGX_T) + diffuse)? That way we keep all GGX terms in one place and can normalize them combined. Can be hard when GGX_T does total internal reflection with a scale.
  * See how gltf distinguishes between opacity, cutout and refracting. They should be orthogonal, as you can still have refracting perforated microgeometry. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_transmission/README.md
   * Cutout implies thinwalled and opacity is subpixel cutout, so does opacity < 1 imply thinwalled as well? Otherwise definining the medium that the light moves through gets 'tricky'
  * Support for absorption / Beers law. Add case to transmission test scene. Whisky in glass? (Cylinder inside glass)
   * Suppport for nested layers? Add (ice) cubes to the whisky. Make a tesselated box, bevel the edges and randomly offset the side vertices. Add air bubble inside the ice cubes.
   * See Yi's post on nested dielectrics and ordering
* Bugs
 * SimpleViewer can't switch between rasterizer and ray tracer using P after alt tabbing. Windows input seems to be recorded correctly, but the keyboard state is wrong. Perhaps a clear/reinitialize is in order?
 * Simpleviewers picture in picture's height/depth ratio doesn't update when the viewport updates
* Bump mapping
 * Create test scene with a plane where one side has proper micro geometry and the other is normal mapped.
 * Use Microfacet-based Normal Mapping for Robust Monte Carlo Path Tracing to solve the energy preservation issue.
 * Or simply negate the part of the shading hemisphere that disagrees with the geometric normal to make a complete hemisphere.
  * That should preserve abs(cos(theta)) as well, so not affect variance adversely
 * Position-Normal Manifold for Efficient Glint Rendering on High-Resolution Normal Maps for efficient stable LOD / roughness under minimization.
* Linearly transformed cosine area lights, and set up tests to verify that it works.

 * Additional light types. Square, tube, ring, ... The ring light should be the reflectance of the outer disk minus the reflectance of the inner disk.

* Emissive meshes
 * Mirror glTF for starters. Emissive texture and emissive 'strength'
  * https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_emissive_strength/README.md
 * Do something similar to or reuse the fixed light samples in PresampledEnvironmentLight and add MIS
  * Presample mesh lights. Handle textures by random sampling and then do reestimated importance sampling when combining samples. Cheapest memory wise, parallelisable, and a pretty simple solution.
 * Efficient triangle sampling

* Remove color banding
 * http://www.loopit.dk/banding_in_games.pdf, see slide 37 and 38 for handling linear to sRGB backbuffers
* Threadsafe asset management
 * Assets shouldn't be copied on resize/reserve, as that gives issues when multithreading asset creation.
  * Instead we can allocate the assets in chunks and just allocate more chunks as needed. Linked list style
  * To avoid dereferencing multiple pointers whenever an asset's property is accessed, we can just return the (now static) reference to the asset. So instead of having Images::get_size, we'll instead use Images::get(image_ID) to return an image and then call get_size on that.
 * Allow multithreaded UID generation
 * Use the threadsafe asset management in model loaders to parallelize asset loading and creation.
* ReSTIR
 * Start with the simpler Spatiotemporal variance-guided filtering: real-time reconstruction for path-traced global illumination
 * Generalized Resampled Importance Sampling
 * Change the rng seed to be based on a frame count instead of an accumulation count
  * How will that affect non-ReSTIR
* Blue noise seed
 * PBRTs random morton code seed looks pretty simple (and I do love a good morton code)
  * Make ZSobolSampler 'progressive' with fixed 256 sample offset in between the pixels.
 * Heitz and Georgiev blue noise screen space seed scheme.
* Sheen for simple cloth rendering - Practical Multiple-Scattering Sheen Using Linearly Transformed Cosines, https://tizianzeltner.com/projects/Zeltner2022Practical/
* Photon mapping
 * How can we ensure that refractions handle bidirectional renderers? PBRT does it by tracing 'importance' or radiance. I think I'd prefer to just differentiate on samping wo or wi.
  * The current implementation samples wi from wo, but internally it acts as if wo is wi. See both the reflectance scaling and refract(...) expects the incident light direction.
  * See PBRT section 16.1. Apparently light rays need to be scaled, but not view rays.
* SDF shadows - check UE4

* SSAO
 * Compute SSAO based on geometric/screenspace normals and filter based on shading normals.
  * That way we avoid issues with the SSAO hemisphere selfshadowing (think spherical cube), but we still filter across hard boundaries if they are defined as smooth.
 * Intensity should be relative to sample distance, not absolute distance intensity.
  * When hitting the screen space max radius then results should be independent of the world radius. Are they? Test scene with three 'infinite' walls.
* Iridescent clear coat.
