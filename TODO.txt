BACKLOG:
* Coverage behaves weirdly in both renderers
** Play with coverage / cutout on plastic material in test scene.
** Center looks like it gets brighter and only pops in after N frames
*** The same effect might be visible in Sponza under the pots/plants
** Center isn't visible behind other geometry.
** Rose and grass has streaky artifacts in rungholt/house as opacity, but fint as cutout
* Dump multi scattering contribution in specular lobe instead of diffuse.
** Could make it simpler to make the coat a separate interface instead of build into the default material.
** Move area light abstractions out into util functions?
*** Remove world to shading as parameter?
*** Improve documentation.
**** Why is AO scaled?
**** What's that nearly diffuse or mirror special case in GGX? And why does it ignore AO?
**** Why does the nearly mirror specular rings in TestScene have (strong) AO?
**** Can we reduce the amount of computations done inside the branches?
*** Can we take the coming split into account? Is there any shared GGX/lambert area light code?
*** There are some shared variables; light center, radiance, ambient visibility, that'll have to be precomputed in then passed to the actual BSDF implementations.
*** We can have a shading model wrapper, similar to in optix, that handles these precomputations and dispatches to the different light modes
* Normals revisited
** Implement Solving Self-Intersection Artifacts in DirectX Raytracing in OptiX, to avoid hard shadows on tesselated spheres.
*** https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/solving-self-intersection-artifacts-in-directx-raytracing/
*** Will probably require an origin per new ray, so one for light samples and one for BSDF samples
** Cubical sphere's in sphere scene are partially see-through near the border.
*** Toggling thin-walled has a pretty drastic effect even though all intersections should be on the outside
* Rough glass
** Test that PDF is always positive if reflectance is positive
*** Test for entire sphere, not just expected hemisphere.
** Change integrators such that shading normal doesn't always point towards the camera and can be used to differentiate between front and backside intersections in GGX.
** Add rough glass shading model
*** Rough glass sheet test scene.
** Can we use Bounded VNDF when the IOR is greater (or was it less) than 1.0? So cases where the refraction will cause more of the lobe to be occluded.
** Allow ior of 1, which is effectively tinting the transmission.
*** See PBRTv4 bxdfs.cpp line 80: if (eta == 1 || mfDistrib.EffectivelySmooth()) { .. }
*** What is 'EffectivelySmooth' defined as?
*** PBRT handles it as a delta dirac, which I'd still like to avoid
** Approximate rough glass in DX11 using a guassian filter, see Doom 2016.
* Bump mapping
** Taming the Shadow Terminator for 'proper' handling of hemisphere distortion. Only scales the contribution. Mirror surfaces still have to be handled differently
*** https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2020/02/shadow-terminator-in-takua.html
** Approach it the same way that Heitz did with multiple bounces.
** Or simply flip the normal or correct back facing, similar to the original shading normal.

* Threadsafe asset management
** Assets shouldn't be copied on resize/reserve, as that gives issues when multithreading asset creation.
*** Instead we can allocate the assets in chunks and just allocate more chunks as needed. Linked list style
*** To avoid dereferencing multiple pointers whenever an asset's property is accessed, we can just return the (now static) reference to the asset. So instead of having Images::get_size, we'll instead use Images::get(image_ID) to return an image and then call get_size on that.
** Allow multithreaded UID generation
** Use the threadsafe asset management in model loaders to parallelize asset loading and creation.
* Upgrade OptiX to get better denoiser
* ReSTIR
** Generalized Resampled Importance Sampling
* Progressive multijittered sample sequences
** Sampling artifacts on backside of middle sphere in MaterialScene and missing yellow/green color on the right floor in VeachScene for the first many frames.
** Owen scrambled sobol sequence - https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/l1go2r/owenscrambled_sobol_02_sequences_shadertoy/
** Test lighthouse sampler
** Unit test for different sampling scenarios with PMJ sampler
** Heitz and Georgiev blue noise screen space seed scheme. Optimize towards equal distribution of first four seeds. Seed, swap row/columns and then optimize random cells.
*** Toroidal shift + random sample index?
*** Toroidal shift using 14 bit bitmask, right-shift by 1 pr dimension and reinsert the swapped bit as the most significant one.
** Pregenerate samples with 64 bluenoise samples for OptiX.

* SSAO
** Compute SSAO based on geometric/screenspace normals and filter based on shading normals.
*** That way we avoid issues with the SSAO hemisphere selfshadowing (think spherical cube), but we still filter across hard boundaries if they are defined as smooth.
** Intensity should be relative to sample distance, not absolute distance intensity.
*** When hitting the screen space max radius then results should be independent of the world radius. Are they? Test scene with three 'infinite' walls.
** Try seeding with hilbert curve + hash from 'Stratified sampling for stochastic transparency'
* SSBN
** Bent normal
*** Path tracer backend (Also one for SSAO?)
*** For diffuse env map lookup.
*** For cones compute aparture from visibility
*** Intersect bent cone with light cone or distribution and bake into 3D LUT (GTSO)
